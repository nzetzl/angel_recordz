		<p class="text-light">My name is Mark Zetzl and music is one of my greatest
passions in life. I have love and respect for all genres of
music and for all peoples and cultures. I want to share my
gifts, talents and knowledge for music with others in order
to help develop a greater understanding of music and of
life from the basics to the complexities and over a wide
variety of perspectives. I want to share my passion to

inspire passion in others.</p>
		<p class="text-light">I grew up surrounded by music in many aspects of my life.
My parents were my initial inspiration. I was going to their
gigs helping set up and tear down PAs before I knew how
to play a guitar. I started running sound for shows in high
school and I played in my first bands at Cardinal Ritter.
Before that I was in choir at St. Gabriel the Archangel
Elementary School. The first instrument I learned was my
voice. In 5th grade I started playing piano. In 8th grade I was
given my first guitar and I fell in love with it. A few years
after that I started writing and recording my own music.
After High School I learned how to play the drums and the
bass as well. At that same time I was given the opportunity
to be a member of a more serious band and we played in
and around the state of Indiana with some prominent
names in the metal music scene; unfortunately, the music
industry is a tough industry to break into and we were not
able to get all the way in the door although we came very
close. Nevertheless I am still here and I am still putting my
heart and soul into what I love and giving it more now than

I ever have. I have worked as the entertainment chair of
the St. Gabriel International Festival since 2015. I have
also worked with the Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra and
will continue to do so. I have been able to use my
knowledge of the ins and outs of the music industry to put
together many events over the years from festivals to
battles of the bands, parties and much more. Through the
years I have become well acquainted with the music
scene in Indianapolis and have made lifetime friends

because of it.</p>
		<p class="text-light">I feel so very fortunate to have been given the gifts and
opportunities to be a part of the music world on so many
different levels. My goal is to now share what I have
learned in the same way that it was shared with me,
through a deeply inspired passion and love for music and
life. I am incredibly excited for Angel Recordz and I canâ€™t
wait to see what the future holds. Thank you so much for
taking the time to Check us out! We hope to see you soon!</p>
